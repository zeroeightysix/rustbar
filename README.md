# rustbar
A wayland status bar written in pure rust. Aimed at tiling window managers.

Code may not be idiomatic rust. This is my first rust project.

## Current state of project
Unless you plan to contribute or look at the code, ignore this repository.
The application is not useful yet.

## Compile
Assuming you have `git` and `cargo` installed:
```
git clone https://github.com/zeroeightysix/rustbar
cargo build --release
target/build/rustbar
```
(`cargo run` in development)
